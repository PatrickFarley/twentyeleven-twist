## Typography

### Fonts

Warnock-pro for blog. Then sub for a [Palatino variant](https://practicaltypography.com/palatino-alternatives.html#)

Venetian is most like ancient Rome, but we're not going for a "historical wisdom" vibe. More like a faint neo-renaissance vibe.

## Stylesheets

Scripts expose a light/dark switch in the WP dashboard, which toggles the use of dark.css. dark.css overwrites certain color values in style.css.

style.css has most style choices.

## PHP structure files

Define the structure of different page types. Define how to read from the database.
